## What I Have Completed
- Implemented layout with **HTML, TailwindCSS, SwiperJS, Boxicons**.
- Used the **exact fonts, font sizes, colors, and spacings** from the Figma design.
- Achieved **pixel-perfect implementation** at **1920px screen width** (same as the design).
- Added **interactive states** for better user experience:
  - Hover effects on interactive elements.
  - Carousel/slider implemented in most sections using SwiperJS.

## What I Could Not Complete (Due to Limited Time)
- **Responsive design**:
  - The layout is pixel-perfect at 1920px but not fully responsive across other screen sizes.

- **Carousel in some sections**:  
  - *Tour Categories* and *What Clients Say About Us* do not have a working carousel.
  - More time is needed to customize SwiperJS for these layouts.
  - Carousels were implemented successfully in the other sections.

## Future Improvements (If I Had More Time)
- Make the entire layout fully responsive for different screen sizes.
- Complete the missing carousels (*Tour Categories* and *What Clients Say About Us*).
- Optimize code structure and reusability for easier maintenance.
